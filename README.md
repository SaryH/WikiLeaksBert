# WikiLeaksBert
 A simple test project written using a Jupyter notebook. The purpose is for the users to input the topic they want answers about, the code then scrapes wikileaks for documents that are relevant to the topic. Then the users input their question, and the code utilzes BertForQuestionAnswering and the documents retreived from the previous phase in order to try answering the question. This was just a fun idea, one tested example was about the topic of "Area 51", and the question was "Are there aliens in area 51?". The model answered with: "sorry but no space aliens"!
